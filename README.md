## Current development workflow.

I don't do an awful lot of development anymore and what little I do is based around Jupyter notebooks.

I use VScode as an editor, Github as a source code management system, and my laptop as a development environment.

My workflow is fairly conventional; I clone files from GitHub to my laptop, edit and test any changes using VScode and, when I'm happy, push the changes back up to Github.

## Tablet based workflow

When Microsoft released Codespaces, I realized that I could do most of my testing in the cloud rather than on my laptop. Eventually this led me to rethink my entire workflow.

Here's what I now do.

1. Create a test banch directly on Github.
2. Link a Codespace to this branch.
3. Run VScode in the the Codespace editing and testing as required.
4. Complete the cycle by issuing a PR and merge on the *main* branch.

There are huge advantages to this approach.
* I no longer need to maintain a laptop development environment.
* I can align the Codespace with my requirements, rather than the constraints of my laptop.
* Since all of the development is in the cloud all I need is a laptop with a modern browser. 

In fact I no longer need a laptop at all!   


All of my development and testing is now done through an ipad, arguably a Surface Pro would be even better.

## Conclusions

This approach to development will soon be the norm. because of it's convenience and scalability. As everything migrates to the browser, partisan arguments about the underlying operating system will become increasingly irrelevant to the vast majority of developers.
